  abstract={Music exhibits some cross-cultural similarities, despite its variety across the world. Evidence from a broad range of human cultures suggests the existence of musical universals1, here defined as strong regularities emerging across cultures above chance. In particular, humans demonstrate a general proclivity for rhythm, although little is known about why music is particularly rhythmic and why the same structural regularities are present in rhythms around the world. We empirically investigate the mechanisms underlying musical universals for rhythm, showing how music can evolve culturally from randomness. Human participants were asked to imitate sets of randomly generated drumming sequences and their imitation attempts became the training set for the next participants in independent transmission chains. By perceiving and imitating drumming sequences from each other, participants turned initially random sequences into rhythmically structured patterns. Drumming patterns developed into rhythms that are more structured, easier to learn, distinctive for each experimental cultural tradition and characterized by all six statistical universals found among world music; the patterns appear to be adapted to human learning, memory and cognition. We conclude that musical rhythm partially arises from the influence of human cognitive and biological biases on the process of cultural evolution.},

 abstract = {This paper introduces the concept of Kugelschwung, a digital musical instrument centrally based around the use of pendulums and lasers to create unique and highly interactive electronic ambient soundscapes. Here, we explore the underlying design and physical construction of the instrument, as well as its implementation and feasibility as an instrument in the real world. To conclude, we outline potential expansions to the instrument, describing how its range of applications can be extended to accommodate a variety of musical styles.},

@inproceedings{Gyrotyre,
 abstract = {This paper presents a novel controller built to exploit thephysical behaviour of a simple dynamical system, namely aspinning wheel. The phenomenon of gyroscopic precessioncauses the instrument to slowly oscillate when it is spunquickly, providing the performer with proprioceptive feedback. Also, due to the mass of the wheel and tire and theresulting rotational inertia, it maintains a relatively constant angular velocity once it is set in motion. Various sensors were used to measure continuous and discrete quantitiessuch as the the angular frequency of the wheel, its spatialorientation, and the performer's finger pressure. In addition, optical and hall-effect sensors detect the passing of aspoke-mounted photodiode and two magnets. A base software layer was developed in Max/MSP and various patcheswere written with the goal of mapping the dynamic behaviorof the wheel to varied musical processes.},
